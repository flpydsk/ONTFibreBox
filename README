Box to extend the fibre from the chorus 100/200 ONT's

adapts to single APC LC

Note:
Using this is against the chorus terms of service. their given reasoning is it could impact national avalability.
In my opinion This is BS but use this at your own risk and knowing you are breaking the chorus TOS.

This is designed to not damage or modify any existing things so this change can be reverted without chorus knowing.

Ensure everything is APC(green connector) for PON stuff

Parts list:
1x https://www.fs.com/au/products/76115.html (This is a tray of 10. FS do not sell less than that. keep some extras incase you fuck up the connector on the ONT you can replace it by removing the back)
1x https://www.fs.com/au/products/41918.html (Fibre cable. get some extra length and leave service loops so you can move stuff)

Please remember to keep all optical components clean
